and more. You edit the playlist from any phone, tablet, or computer using a
range of MPD and web clients.

comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. Search for the "Mopidy" add-on in the Home Assistant add-on store
   and install it.
1. Install the "Mopidy" add-on.
1. Start the "Mopidy" add-on.
1. Check the logs of the "Mopidy" add-on to see if everything went well.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml

### Option: `settings`

This option allows you to tweak every aspect of Mopidy by setting
configuration options. See the example at the start of this chapter
to get an idea of how the configuration looks.

For more information about using these settings, see the official Mopidy
documentation:

<https://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/config/>

**Note**: _This option support secrets, e.g., `!secret spotify_password`._

### Option: `system_packages`

Allows you to specify additional [Debian packages][debian-packages] to
be installed in your shell environment (e.g., Python, PHP, Go).

**Note**: _Adding many packages will result in a longer start-up
time for the add-on._

### Option: `python_packages`

Allows you to specify additional [Python packages][python-packages] to be
installed to your Mopidy setup (e.g., `PyMySQL`. `Requests`, `Pillow`).

**Note**: _Adding many packages will result in a longer start-up time
for the add-on._

### Option: `leave_front_door_open`

Adding this option to the add-on configuration allows you to disable
authentication on the Mopidy by setting it to `true`.

**Note**: _We STRONGLY suggest, not to use this, even if this add-on is
only exposed to your internal network. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!_
