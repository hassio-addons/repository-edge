# Home Assistant Community Add-on: JupyterLab

JupyterLab is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share
documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.
Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation,
statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

This add-on runs JupyterLab, which is the next-generation user interface for
Project Jupyter. It is an extensible environment for interactive and
reproducible computing, based on the Jupyter Notebook and Architecture.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. Search for the "JupyterLab" add-on in the Supervisor add-on store
   and install it.
1. Start the "JupyterLab" add-on
1. Check the logs of the "JupyterLab" add-on to see if everything went well.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
log_level: info
github_access_token: abcdef1234567890abcdef0123456789abcdef01
system_packages:
  - ffmpeg
init_commands:
  - pip install virtualenv
  - pip install yamllint
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and past it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `github_access_token`

Sets an GitHub access token. When making unauthenticated requests to GitHub
(as we must do to get repository data), GitHub imposes fairly strict rate-limits
on how many requests we can make. As such, you are likely to hit that limit
within a few minutes of work.

There is a chapter in this document with instruction on obtaining such a token.

**Note**: _This option support secrets, e.g., `!secret github_token`._

### Option: `system_packages`

Allows you to specify additional [Alpine packages][alpine-packages] to be
installed to your JupyterLab setup (e.g., `g++`. `make`, `ffmpeg`).

**Note**: _Adding many packages will result in a longer start-up time
for the add-on._

#### Option: `init_commands`

Customize your environment even more with the `init_commands` option.
Add one or more shell commands to the list, and they will be executed every
single time this add-on starts.

## Getting a GitHub access token

You can get an access token by following these steps:

1. [Verify][github-verify] your email address with GitHub.
1. Go to your account settings on GitHub and select "Developer Settings"
   from the left panel.
1. On the left, select "Personal access tokens"
1. Click the "Generate new token" button, and enter your password.
1. Give the token a description, and check the "**repo**" scope box.
1. Click "Generate token"
1. You should be given a string which will be your access token.

Remember that this token is effectively a password for your GitHub account.
_Do not_ share it online or check the token into version control,
as people can use it to access all of your data on GitHub.
