Fighting disease with a world wide distributed super computer.

## About

Folding@home (FAH or F@h) is a distributed computing project for performing
molecular dynamics simulations of protein dynamics. Its initial focus was on
protein folding but has shifted to more biomedical problems, such as Alzheimer's
disease, cancer, Ebola and the coronavirus.

The project uses the idle processing resources of personal computers owned by
volunteers who have installed the software on their systems.

Now you can donate the idle time of your Home Assistant instance to the
Folding@home project, helping to fight these diseases.
