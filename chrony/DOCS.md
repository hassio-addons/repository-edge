# Home Assistant Community Add-on: chrony

An NTP server accessible by all hosts on the local network, useful for setting
time on devices with controlled internet access (such as cameras).
The addon can also be used to set the system clock.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. Search for the "chrony" add-on in the add-on store and install it.
1. Start the "chrony" add-on
1. Check the logs of the "chrony" add-on to see if everything went well.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
set_system_clock: true
mode: pool
ntp_pool: pool.ntp.org
ntp_server:
  - 54.39.13.155
  - briareus.schulte.org
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `set_system_clock`

The `set_system_clock` option configures chrony to set the local system clock.
For some systems it may be preferable to use a different mechanism for
setting the system time.

### Option: `mode`

The `mode` option configures chrony to use either `pool` or `server` mode.
These options are:

- `pool`: References a pool of servers such as pool.ntp.org (Recommended).
- `server`: References a list of specific names or addresses.

Based on the mode the `ntp_pool` or `ntp_server` option will be used.

### Option: `ntp_pool`

Used by pool mode and configures the pool name to be used, should be a DNS
record with multiple entries. The application will select which to reference.

### Option: `ntp_server`

Used by server mode, an array of server names or IP Addresses used as the
time source. The application will select which to reference.
