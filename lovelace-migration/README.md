This add-on automatically converts your existing UI to the new Lovelace UI.

## About

The new Lovelace UI for Home Assistant is here, and it is extremely fast,
extremely customizable and extremely extensible.

Building the Lovelace UI configuration from scratch can be a bit of a
daunting task, so this add-on helps create a starting point to work from.
In most cases you will only need to run this add-on once, but if ever you
do you need to run it again, backups of your existing `ui-lovelace.yaml` file
are automatically created and maintained.
