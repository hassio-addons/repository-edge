# Home Assistant Community Add-on: Bookstack

BookStack is a simple, self-hosted, easy-to-use platform for organising and
storing information. Please support the developers of this software at
[Bookstack].

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. Search for the "bookstack" add-on in the add-on store and install it.
1. Start the "bookstack" add-on
1. Check the logs of the "bookstack" add-on to see if everything went well.
1. Default login information is admin@admin.com/password.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
log_level: info
ssl: false
certfile: fullchain.pem
keyfile: privkey.pem
envvars:
  - name: SESSION_COOKIE_NAME
    value: bookstack_session
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `ssl`

Enables/Disables SSL (HTTPS) on the web interface of Bookstack
Panel. Set it `true` to enable it, `false` otherwise.

### Option: `certfile`

The certificate file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default_

### Option: `keyfile`

The private key file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default_

### Option: `proxy_host`

If using a reverse proxy, the domain configured for example
`https://www.example.com`.

### Option: `remote_mysql_host`

If using an external database, the hostname/address for the MYSQL/MariaDB
database.

### Option: `remote_mysql_database`

Only applies if a remote MYSQL database is used, the name of the database.

### Option: `remote_mysql_username`

Only applies if a remote MYSQL database is used, the username with permissions.

### Option: `remote_mysql_password`

Only applies if a remote MYSQL database is used, the password of the above user.

### Option: `remote_mysql_port`

Only applies if a remote MYSQL database is used, the port that the database
server is listening on.

### Option: `envvars`

This allows the setting of Environment Variables to control Bookstack
configuration as documented at:

<https://www.bookstackapp.com/docs/>

**Note**: _Changing these options can possibly cause issues with you instance.
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!_

These are case sensitive and any items set by specific configuration will take
precedence.

#### Sub-option: `name`

The name of the environment variable to set.

#### Sub-option: `value`

The value of the environment variable to set.

## Database usage

By default, Bookstack will automatically use and configure the Home Assistant
MariaDB addon which should be installed prior to startup, this can be changed
within the configuration to use an external MySql/MariaDB Database. Please note
that there is no easy upgrade path between the two options.

## Known issues and limitations

- SMTP support is disabled.
- Ingress will not function due to the way the application stores image files.
