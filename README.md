## WARNING! THIS IS AN EDGE REPOSITORY

This Hass.io Add-ons repository contains edge builds of add-ons. Edge builds
add-ons are based upon the latest development version.

- They might stop working at any time.
- They could have a negative impact on your system.

This repository was created for:

- Anybody willing to test.
- Anybody interested in trying out upcoming add-ons or add-on features.
- Developers.
