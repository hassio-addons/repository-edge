## WARNING

The advanced SSH & Web Terminal add-on is a really powerful and gives you
virtually access to all tools and almost all hardware of your system.

While this add-on is created and maintained with care and with security in mind,
in the wrong or inexperienced hands, it could damage your system.

## Features

This add-on, of course, provides an SSH server, based on [OpenSSH][openssh] and
a web-based Terminal (which can be included in your Home Assistant frontend) as
well. Additionally, it comes out of the box with the following:

- Access your command line right from the Home Assistant frontend!
- A secure default configuration of SSH:
  - Only allows login by the configured user, even if more users are created.
  - Only uses known secure ciphers and algorithms.
  - Limits login attempts to hold off brute-force attacks better.
- Comes with an SSH compatibility mode option to allow older clients to connect.
- Support for Mosh allowing roaming and supports intermittent connectivity.
- SFTP support is disabled by default but is user configurable.
- Compatible if Home Assistant was installed via the generic Linux installer.
- Username is configurable, so `root` is no longer mandatory.
- Persists custom SSH client settings & keys between add-on restarts
- Log levels for allowing you to triage issues easier.
- Hardware access to your audio, uart/serial devices and GPIO pins.
- Runs with more privileges, allowing you to debug and test more situations.
- Has access to the dbus of the host system.
- Has the option to access the Docker instance running on the host system.
- Runs on host level network, allowing you to open ports or run little daemons.
- Have custom Alpine packages installed on start. This allows you to install
  your favorite tools, which will be available every single time you log in.
- Execute custom commands on add-on start so that you can customize the
  shell to your likings.
- [ZSH][zsh] as its default shell. Easier to use for the beginner, more advanced
  for the more experienced user. It even comes preloaded with
  ["Oh My ZSH"][ohmyzsh], with some plugins enabled as well.
- Contains a sensible set of tools right out of the box: curl, Wget, RSync, GIT,
  Nmap, Mosquitto client, MariaDB/MySQL client, Awake (“wake on LAN”), Nano,
  Vim, tmux, and a bunch commonly used networking tools.
