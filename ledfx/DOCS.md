# Home Assistant Community Add-on: ledfx

LedFx is a network based LED effect controller with support for advanced
real-time audio effects! LedFx can control multiple devices and works great
with cheap ESP8266 nodes allowing for cost effective syncronised effects across
your entire house!

## Important

This application is designed to be run locally, not exposed to the Internet.
Please do not allow access to it externally.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. Search for the "ledfx" add-on in the add-on store and install it.
1. Select the correct audio device for input.
1. Start the "ledfx" add-on
1. Check the logs of the "ledfx" add-on to see if everything went well.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
ssl: false
certfile: fullchain.pem
keyfile: privkey.pem
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `ssl`

Enables/Disables SSL (HTTPS) on the web interface of ledfx
Panel. Set it `true` to enable it, `false` otherwise.

### Option: `certfile`

The certificate file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default_

### Option: `keyfile`

The private key file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default_
