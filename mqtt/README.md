Mosquitto MQTT Server bundled with Hivemq's web client.

## About

This add-on combines the power of [Hivemq][hivemq]'s
web-based MQTT client, and the powerful [Mosquitto][mosquitto]
broker (MQTT Server). With this, you can host your own MQTT server,
and inspect/publish messages using the built-in web client!
