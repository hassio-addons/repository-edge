Protect your privacy and access Home Assistant via Tor.

## About

This Tor add-on allows you to access you Home Assistant instance as an Onion site,
trough [Tor's Hidden Service][tor-hidden-service] feature. With this feature
enabled, you do not need to open your firewall ports or setup HTTPS to enable
secure remote access.

This is useful if you want to have:

- Access your Home Assistant instance remotely without opening a firewall port
  or setting up a VPN.
- Don’t want to or know how to get an SSL/TLS certificate and HTTPS
  configuration setup.
- Want to block attackers from even being able to access/scan your port and
  server at all.
- Want to block anyone from knowing your home IP address and seeing your
  traffic to your Home Assistant.

The add-on also offers the possibility to open a Sock proxy into the
Tor network. Allowing you to access Tor from any of your (SOCKS supporting)
applications through your Home Assistant installation.
