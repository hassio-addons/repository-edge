   and install it.

1. Check the logs of the "SQLite Web" add-on to see if everything went well.
1. Click "OPEN WEB UI" to open the SQLite Web interface.
1. Log in with your Home Assistant user.

**NOTE**: Starting the add-on might take a couple of minutes (especially the
first time starting the add-on).
